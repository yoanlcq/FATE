// Features:
// - Capacity + bounds checking;
// - Typed/untyped duality;
// - API feels like DSA;
// - Optional CPU-side buffer;
// - Kinds (need to be known at creation time):
//   - Flex (BufferData)
//     - Usage: STATIC_, etc....
//     - Allows mapping
//   - Immutable (BufferStorage)
//     - Set data once (DYNAMIC_STORAGE)
//     - Allow mapping (Read | Write | Persistent | Coherent)
//       - If persistent, map when created, unmap when dropped.
//     - asserts that (len < capacity).
//
// Proposals:
// - OneshotBuffer (no DYNAMIC_STORAGE);
// - FlexBuffer (BufferData, Usage);
// - FixedSizeBuffer (BufferStorage)
// - AzdoBuffer (Write | Persistent | Coherent + FenceSwapChain);
// > N.B: NOT paired with a CPU buffer. The CPU data may come from anywhere.
//   Also, splitting them is important to make sure we visually separate *building* the data on
//   the CPU versus *uploading* it to the GPU. Coupling these two saves some typing, but introduces
//   extra complexity and inefficiency in the API. The caller knows better.
