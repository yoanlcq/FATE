// # Problems
//
// ## Physics
//
// I want fast ray-casting in the whole scene's geometry.
// Usages include:
// - Terrain collision detection;
// - Collision _prediction_.
//
// ## Rendering
//
// I don't want to use cascaded shadow maps. Reasons are:
// - It's kinda slow and wasteful.
// - It's hard to make it look right (i.e not pixelated, and choose a correct bias, etc);
// - It looks like a hierarchical data structure, which I don't like.
//
// I would like not having to use light maps. Reasons are:
// - The PBR pipeline more or less does this by itself;
// - I don't want to deal with static/dynamic duality of lights.
// - I would like to avoid having to _bake_ stuff.
// - Light maps are complicated to implement.
//
// Goals:
// - Precise hard shadows;
// - Nice-looking soft shadows;
// - In real-time, with world streaming.
//
// Domain knowledge:
// - The world is large, doesn't move, and is super sparse, especially since we're dealing with surfaces, not solids (i.e the interior of a mesh is just air).
// - A few objects move. 
// - A few lights move (e.g the Sun, or torches (adding noise to the position every frame)).
//
// # Idea
// - Have a super-low LOD version of the scene's geometry (NB: in which we only need to store vertex positions and normals); it's the one that will be used for ray-casting.
// - All of the high-LOD scene's triangles are already in GPU memory (large buffer already used by DrawIndirect())
// - The same is true for the low-LOD scene;
// - In the usual high-LOD scene rendering step via DrawIndirect(), care to write these in renderbuffers:
//   - Depth; used for knowing the fragment's 3D world position;
//   - Normal; used for discarding a ray early if the fragment is already in shadow.
// - For each fragment, cast a ray from the fragment's 3D world position towards the light source, WITHIN some in-GPU representation of the super-low LOD scene.
//   The first test is "if dot(fragment_normal, dir_to_light) < 0 { return; }". Indeed, if a fragment is facing away from the light, we know it's already in shadow.
//   If the ray intersects any triangle before reaching the light, then the fragment is shadowed.
// - The question is, how to make the intersection test fast enough for rendering every frame?
//
// # One solution
//
// Throughout the whole thing, I want:
// - Memory and speed statistics;
// - Ability to tweak settings in real time and see the impact via stats.
//
// Split the scene into "objects". Factors to take into account are: sparsity, moving or not, and level of detail (as in, distance from the camera).
// An example would be:
// - The main character; Not sparse, moving, and close to camera.
// - The nearby large cave entrance: Sparse, not moving, somewhat close to camera.
// - The surrounding desert: Sparse, not moving, somewhat close to camera.
// - The canyon in the faraway distance: Sparse, not moving, very far from camera.
//
// Each object is assigned a low-res 3D texture, representing a voxel grid.
// The voxel grid's world-space scale is big enough to contain the object no matter its current animation pose.
// The voxel grid's resolution should be kinda low, but adjusted depending on the object's sparsity, wanted level of detail, and the look of the bounding box.
// - Low res => less memory + less cells to traverse, but cells are less likely to be empty.
// - High res => cells are likely to be empty, but this costs more memory, and traversal has to go though more cells.
//
// There's a very few number of such grids (as few as there are "objects"), so we can store all the grids in linear arrays.
//
// For a given object, each voxel of its grid stores 0 to N triangles. (TODO: how exactly?)
//
// Then, the GPU ray-casting algorithm looks like this:
// - if dot(fragment_normal, dir_to_light) < 0 { return; }
// - Find the potentially-intersecting grids (using AABB tests).
// - Note that AABBs may contain one another. So we have to find the intersection in _each_ grid, and return only the closest.
//   But if our ray casting is a boolean query (= "is there anything between my origin and the light?"), then we can return as soon as we find any intersection.
// - For each grid, traverse voxels using 3DDDA.
// - When traversing a voxel, rasterize by hand the triangles it contains into a 1x1 buffer. If we find something, there's an intersection. Otherwise, we have to keep going.
//
// Q: In the large desert scene, if a ray has no intersection, it has to traverse a lot of cells.
// A: Not if the "objects" are chosen such that as few bounding boxes as needs are selected. There's no bounding box for the air above the sand!

// Design goals:
// - Memory-efficient (assumes voxels are sparse (very much so));
// - Fast insertion;
// - Faster key retrieval (for traversal by rays);
// - Designed as a giant fixed-size buffer, to be directly transferred/mapped to GPU memory;
// - Code is easy to port to computes shaders;
